# Obisidian Alloy Mind

## Description

This is an Obsidian plugin I've built with a set of disparate features to help with my usage of the app.

### Features
1. Organize daily notes from a flat root directory into weekly directories
2. Copy daily notes' dream journal entries into yearly dream journal notes
3. Add up time entries for a given daily note (A holdover from my time using the app as a consultant)
4. Highlight a word and lookup its definition

## Deploy

1. Set the `OBSIDIAN` environment variable to the root directory of the Obsidian vault you want to deploy to.
2. Run `yarn build:deploy`

## Debug

Use `ctrl + shift + i` on Windows or `option + cmd + i` on Mac in Obsidian to open the developer console and view logs
